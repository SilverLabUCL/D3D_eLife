# D3D
This is a distribution of D3D, a software package for computing diffusion-reaction simulations in 3D using either finite-difference or Monte Carlo algorithms. This version of D3D has been specifically formatted to run simulations for the following eLife paper:

"Physical determinants of vesicle mobility and supply at a central synapse"
Rothman JS, Kocsis L, Herzog E, Nusser Z, Silver RA
eLife. 2016 Aug 19.
pii: e15133
doi: 10.7554/eLife.15133

Once the java code has been compiled and executed, a GUI will be created with an "eLife" menu at the top. Users can select which simulation to initialize via the following menu items:

Init Finite-Difference Frap (figures 2C 3D)
Init Monte Carlo FRAP (figures 3C,D 4A,B,D)
Init Monte Carlo FRAP Movie (no figure)
Init Monte Carlo FRAP MSD (figures 4C 5A)
Init Monte Carlo FRAP AZ (figures 7 8)
