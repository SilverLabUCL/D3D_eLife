# D3D
This is a distribution of D3D, software for computing diffusion-reaction simulations in 3D using either finite-difference or Monte Carlo algorithms. This version has been specifically formatted to run simulations for the following eLife paper:

"Physical determinants of vesicle mobility and supply at a central synapse"
Rothman JS, Kocsis L, Herzog E, Nusser Z, Silver RA
eLife. 2016 Aug 19.
pii: e15133
doi: 10.7554/eLife.15133

Once the java code has been compiled and run, a GUI will be created with an "eLife" drop-down menu at the top. Users can select which simulation to initialize. The simulations are as follows:
